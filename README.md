# LATiscite
Simple Latin (to German) vocabulary practice progam

Vocabulary that you knew the translation of is less likely to appear again: There are 5 priority groups - each word is in one of them - and knowing/not knowing a word will affect it's priority group accordingly.

You can also create a filter so that only words from a specific 'lektion' (1..34) are shown.

The apk is in /app/release.
